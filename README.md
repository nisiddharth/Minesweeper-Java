# Minesweeper in Java

A simple Java Swing program for the old-gold Minesweeper game. Just made for fun, don't take it seriously.

## To run
1. Clone the repository
2. Open terminal/ Command Prompt in the main directory
3. Do `javac Minesweeper.java` to compile
4. Do `java Minesweeper` to execute

## Screenshots:

#### On Lose:

## Imperfections
1. Game board is initialized on start of application and not on 1st click [so don't expect your first click to be always safe]
2. Size of board and number of mines cannot be changed unless hardcoded.
3. Click on sweeped area with surronding mines marked does not sweep the neighbouring blocks.
